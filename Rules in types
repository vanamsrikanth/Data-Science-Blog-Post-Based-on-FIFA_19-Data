Since you’re working on a data quality and control framework under the xDP product at Accenture, where data ingestion and anomaly detection play a key role, here are rules tailored to your ETL and data quality framework:

1. CHAR
	•	Use for fixed-length attributes such as country codes, status indicators, or reference data.
	•	Avoid storing variable-length values in CHAR to prevent unnecessary padding.
	•	Data Quality Rule: Ensure consistency in length across all records to prevent truncation.

2. RAW
	•	Suitable for storing binary data, such as encrypted keys, hashes, or unique identifiers.
	•	Should not be converted to VARCHAR2 during processing to avoid data corruption.
	•	Data Quality Rule: Ensure that RAW data is not null and conforms to expected byte length.

3. CLOB (Character Large Object)
	•	Used for storing large text data, such as logs, comments, or JSON/XML documents.
	•	Avoid excessive querying on CLOB fields, as it impacts performance.
	•	Data Quality Rule: Validate that CLOB fields contain properly formatted text (e.g., valid JSON/XML structure).

4. NUMBER
	•	Standard for storing numeric values in calculations and aggregations.
	•	Always specify precision and scale to prevent unintended rounding errors.
	•	Data Quality Rule: Validate numeric fields for range, format, and presence of outliers.

5. LONG
	•	Avoid using LONG, as it is deprecated; migrate to CLOB for large text storage.
	•	Data Quality Rule: Identify legacy LONG columns and plan conversion to CLOB.

6. VARCHAR2
	•	Preferred for storing variable-length text data.
	•	Always define an appropriate length limit to prevent excessive memory usage.
	•	Data Quality Rule: Check for leading/trailing spaces, empty values, and special characters.

7. DATE
	•	Store date values without a timestamp unless required.
	•	Ensure timezone consistency if data is coming from different regions.
	•	Data Quality Rule: Validate date formats and check for incorrect or future-dated records.

8. BLOB (Binary Large Object)
	•	Suitable for image, multimedia, or encrypted files.
	•	Not ideal for frequent querying or searching.
	•	Data Quality Rule: Ensure non-corruption of binary data during transformation.

9. TIMESTAMP(3)
	•	Store date-time values with millisecond precision.
	•	Use when high accuracy is required, such as in transaction logs.
	•	Data Quality Rule: Validate correct timestamp formats and time zone consistency.

10. FLOAT
	•	Should be used only for values requiring approximate precision (e.g., scientific calculations).
	•	Avoid using for financial data due to floating-point precision errors—prefer NUMBER(p,s) instead.
	•	Data Quality Rule: Detect anomalies caused by floating-point rounding.

11. UROWID (Universal Row Identifier)
	•	Used for internal row identification, not for external references.
	•	Should not be modified or exposed in reports.
	•	Data Quality Rule: Validate uniqueness and integrity of UROWID values.

12. TIMESTAMP(6)
	•	Same as TIMESTAMP(3) but with microsecond precision.
	•	Use only when ultra-high precision is needed (e.g., real-time event processing).
	•	Data Quality Rule: Ensure microsecond precision is supported in downstream systems.

These rules align with best practices for data ingestion, quality checks, and anomaly detection in your framework. Would you like any further customization for specific business use cases in xDP?




-------------//

Here are some suggested rules for handling different data types during ETL and auto-suggestion processes:

1. CHAR
	•	Should be used for fixed-length string storage.
	•	If the source column has varying lengths, consider VARCHAR2 instead.
	•	Avoid storing numeric values in CHAR columns to prevent unnecessary conversions.

2. RAW
	•	Used for storing binary data such as encrypted values or hashed data.
	•	Should not be implicitly converted to other data types like VARCHAR2.
	•	Ensure correct encoding/decoding when extracting and loading into different systems.

3. CLOB (Character Large Object)
	•	Ideal for storing large textual data.
	•	Should not be converted to VARCHAR2 unless within the allowed length limits.
	•	Be mindful of performance overhead when querying or processing CLOB data.

4. NUMBER
	•	Should be used for storing numeric values precisely.
	•	If the source system stores values as FLOAT, avoid unnecessary conversion to INTEGER.
	•	Use appropriate precision and scale settings to prevent data truncation.

5. LONG
	•	Deprecated in modern databases; avoid using it for new implementations.
	•	Convert LONG columns to CLOB or VARCHAR2 for better compatibility.
	•	Queries involving LONG data types can have performance issues and restrictions.

6. VARCHAR2
	•	Preferred for variable-length character data.
	•	Ensure length constraints are compatible across source and target systems.
	•	Avoid using VARCHAR2 for numeric values unless required (e.g., for storing formatted numbers).

7. DATE
	•	Should always store date values without time components unless needed.
	•	If time precision is required, prefer TIMESTAMP instead.
	•	Use standard date formats (e.g., YYYY-MM-DD) to maintain consistency across systems.

8. BLOB (Binary Large Object)
	•	Best suited for storing images, multimedia, and encrypted data.
	•	Should not be converted to RAW or VARCHAR2.
	•	Ensure proper handling of encoding formats when extracting or loading.

9. TIMESTAMP(3)
	•	Used for storing date-time values with milliseconds precision.
	•	Ensure that source systems also support millisecond precision to avoid data loss.
	•	Prefer TIMESTAMP(6) if higher precision is required.

10. FLOAT
	•	Avoid converting to INTEGER as it may lead to loss of decimal values.
	•	Prefer NUMBER(p,s) for better control over precision and scale.
	•	Be mindful of floating-point rounding errors when performing calculations.

11. UROWID (Universal Row Identifier)
	•	Used for uniquely identifying rows in a database.
	•	Should not be used as a primary key unless required for internal operations.
	•	Avoid converting UROWID to VARCHAR2, as it may lead to data integrity issues.

12. TIMESTAMP(6)
	•	Similar to TIMESTAMP(3) but supports microsecond precision.
	•	Ensure that target systems can store microseconds to prevent data truncation.
	•	Use only when microsecond accuracy is necessary to optimize storage.
